We lived in Pennsylvania and didn't have any mountain or elevation training, so the race itself was a long, slow walk to the top. Joe got altitude sickness at the summit and became a bit delirious and disoriented. It also hailed near the summit. I still sometimes consdier doing this race again, or maybe the double- the Ascent on Saturday and the full on Sunday.</div>

                <div class="marathon-thoughts">When I was 19, my younger sister and I flew down to Disney World for the weekend. We spent all day Saturday walking around Disney World in flip flops, and had pizza for dinner. On race day, I had a taxi pick me up at 4am to get around the pre-race road closures. Waiting in the dark for the race to start with thousands of people seemed a bit crazy, but it wasn't cold. The parks weren’t open so it was just Disney employees cheering for us, plus all the Disney  characters. I wished I had thought of running with a camera. The weather warmed up to 90 degrees and sunny, and running on cement in between the 5 parks hurt my feet. There were great photos of me running through Cinderella's castle, but at the time I didn't think of buying photos. The race was a unique experience, but not one I'd want to repeat. </div>

                <div class="marathon-thoughts">After a couple months of transition including moving cross country, I was scouring marathon guide for a low key race within "driving distance" of San Francisco. This race fit the bill perfectly, as there were hotel rooms right by the start and finish for a reasonable price, and the race fee wasn't too steep. The course itself wasn't very memorable, though it was flat and fast. The course didn't go into downtown Boise, so it was convenient for Joe to watch me as a spectator. I was thrilled with my finish time, the nice race pullover, the finish line food, and my age group medal. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small to mid-sized race.</div>

Up to that point I had been the third overall female, so I was disappointed to have missed that opportunity.

                <div class="marathon-thoughts">I was very impressed with the organization for this race, even though it's such a huge race. The first mile it was hard to find my stride, but it thinned out quickly. The course is flat and fast and it's neat running my historical buildings, but the last few miles had no crowd support and felt a bit painful. I could probably do better with better pacing. </div>

I really like the scenery in Wyoming and still had a good experience. I was so glad the sun came out at mile 25.5. Would probably not run this one again.</div>
